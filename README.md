grunt-amd-test
==============

Generates test runners for AMD-based projects, and *that's it*! Does not
generate failing test cases or run tests. You can use the following projects to
run the test runners generated by grunt-amd-test:

For QUnit: [grunt-contrib-qunit](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit) 
For jasmine:
[grunt-contrib-jasmine](https://github.com/zship/grunt-contrib-jasmine) (my
fork, stripped down to be *only* a runner)

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`


Installation
-------------

From the same directory as your Gruntfile, run

```
npm install grunt-amd-test
```

Then add the following line to your Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-amd-test');
```

You can verify that the task is available by running `grunt --help` and
checking that "amd-test" is present under "Available tasks".


Usage
-----

grunt-amd-test reads two sections of your config: `amd-test` and `requirejs`.
`amd-test` can contain these properties:

```js
'amd-test': {
	//generate a qunit runner.html or a jasmine runner.html
	mode: 'qunit',
	//mode: 'jasmine',

	//Grunt files configuration object containing all unit tests to be included
	//(more: http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks)
	files: 'test/unit/*.js'
},
```

`requirejs` is a standard [r.js configuration
object](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/example.build.js).
grunt-amd-test uses `basePath`, `paths`, and `packages` (all optional) to
transform file names to AMD module names.

Once these options are in place, `grunt amd-test` will run amd-test.
